CS350C Instruction Set Architecture
===================================

To do the assignment 1, you must specify what commit hash of the Arch project 
that you will be writing your assignment against. If you choose to accept 
Chris's original proposal unchanged, that is sufficient to finish the 
assignment.
 
However, there were many valid points brought up in discussion today that 
we should consider. We need to organize this discussion so that we can have 
a final proposal on which to base future projects. Make changes to the 
repository in the form of a pull request and discuss in the comments. 
As discussion settles, we may vote on a branch for our final consensus.
